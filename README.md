# Recipe Searcher/Finder Application

A Javascript/SASS/HTML project allows the user to search for any food recipe. Additionally, the user can upload their recipes and bookmark their favorite recipes. Bookmarking recipes would store their bookmarks in the local storage, allowing them to access their recipes later, even when the page reloads.
